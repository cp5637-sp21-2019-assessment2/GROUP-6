                        <h3>Business Sustainability</h3>
                    </a>
                    <p>
                    Business and economic sustainability is considered essential for survival of the human race and for the maintenance of the earth as a habitable environment. Damage is being caused by businesses and that damage needs to be stopped, prevented, and repaired if life as it is currently understood is to prevail. Businesses are a part of modern global society and collectively we owe our existence and survival to the life giving sources of the earth. Hence business activities and outputs must be seen from an eco-social perspective more than they need to be seen from a simple economic perspective. This notwithstanding, businesses certainly have an economic imperative however this imperative is for people in general and not for the business per se. People need the planet to sustain life so that any planet-damaging business activities are therefore not in the best interests of the very people the business is economically serving. Therefore businesses are only valid if they truly serve their primary purposes first and foremost and their economic interests second. For businesses to transform to a new paradigm and stay viable, the following four point plan is considered essential for their development and possibly their survival. A new business paradigm, or zeitgeist, is certainly essential for the survival of humanity as we know it.

                        </a>
                        <p>
                                Every business has a desire to increase profits and improve cash flows. The question is whether this can be done while implementing a sustainability program. In the Sustainability Handbook, William Blackburn makes the case for sustainability in a corporate environment where profit and cash flow are drivers. Clearly, a boycott of a company’s goods and services arising from social or environmental issues could have a far greater negative impact on a company’s bottom line than a natural disaster.

                        <p>
                                You set a plan in motion and
                                something will happen. The
                                question is only was it what you
                                planned to happen, or what you
                                hoped would happen, or was it
                                your worst
                                nightmare? Bossidy
                                and Charan feel that
                                companies spend
                                too little time and
                                effort looking after
                                the execution of the
                                plans they make. In
                                fact, they say that,
                                “Execution is the
                                great unaddressed

                                world today.”1[i] So
                                what they are talking
                                about is more than
                                simply execution; it
                                is correct execution.

                                Goals should be
                                    straightforward and
                                    emphasize what you want to
                                    happen. Specifics help us to
                                    focus our efforts and clearly
                                    define what we are going to
                                    do. Specific is the What,
                                    Why, and How of the
                                    SMART model. WHAT
                                    are you going to do? Use
                                    action words such as direct,
                                    organize, coordinate, lead,
                                    develop, plan, build etc.
                                    WHY is this important to do at
                                    this time? What do you want
                                    to ultimately accomplish?
                                    HOW are you going to do it?
                                    Ensure the goal you set is
                                    very specific, clear and easy.
                                    Instead of setting a goal to
                                    lose weight or be healthier,
                                    set a specific goal to lose 2cm
                                    off your waistline or to walk 5
                                    miles at an aerobically
                                    challenging pace.
